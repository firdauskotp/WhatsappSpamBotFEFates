# Getting Started
Install the pyautogui first by typing pip install pyautogui in the terminal

# What to do once run?
When you run the code, immediately head to the chat that you want to spam, the text will auto type and enter on where the cursor is clicked on after the code is run. If you click
somewhere else during that time, the message will continue on that screen

# Cursed.txt
You can replace this with any message in your text file. For me I just copied paste the entire Camilla support from the Fire Emblem wiki
